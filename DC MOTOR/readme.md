# ⚙️ Conveyor Motor Drive System

This folder contains the details for the conveyor belt drive mechanism, which transports PCBs through the coating machine. It features a high-torque DC motor driver circuit and a mechanical gearbox transmission.

## 📝 Overview
To ensure the PCB moves smoothly for even coating, we use a 12V DC motor equipped with an **external gearbox**. This gearbox reduces speed while increasing torque, allowing the belt to run at a constant, slow pace without stalling. The motor speed is regulated via **PWM** signals from the STM32 controller.

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram
The motor is driven using a **Low-Side MOSFET Switch**. This design was chosen for efficiency and direct compatibility with the STM32's 3.3V logic.

### Component Breakdown
* **NTD5867 (N-Channel MOSFET):** Acts as the main switch. It is "Logic Level," meaning the 3.3V signal from the STM32 is strong enough to turn it fully on without extra drivers.
* **1N4007 (Flyback Diode):** Protects the MOSFET from high-voltage spikes (back EMF) generated by the motor when it stops.
* **220Ω Resistor:** Limits current to the MOSFET gate to protect the STM32 pin.
* **10kΩ Resistor:** A pull-down resistor that keeps the motor OFF if the microcontroller signal is disconnected or starting up.

## ⚙️ Mechanical Specs
* **Motor Type:** 12V DC Brushed Motor.
* **Transmission:** External Reduction Gearbox.
* **Purpose:** Converts high RPM into high torque/low speed for steady conveyor movement.

## 📊 Technical Details
| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input Voltage** | 12V DC |
| **Logic Voltage** | 3.3V (STM32 Compatible) |
| **Control Method** | PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) |
| **Driver Topology** | Low-Side Switch |

## 💻 Usage
The motor speed is controlled by varying the PWM duty cycle in the firmware:
* **Duty Cycle:** Controls speed (0% = Stop, 100% = Full Speed).
* **Frequency:** Set to >20kHz to prevent audible motor noise.
